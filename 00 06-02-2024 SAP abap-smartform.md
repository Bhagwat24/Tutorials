Sure, here's a basic example of how you can create a simple Smart Form in ABAP along with some sample code:

1. First, create a Smart Form in the SAP system using transaction `SMARTFORMS`. Let's name it `ZSAMPLE_SMARTFORM`.

2. Open the Smart Form `ZSAMPLE_SMARTFORM` and design it according to your requirements. For this example, let's create a simple form with a header, some text, and a table.

3. After designing the Smart Form, save and activate it.

4. Now, you can write ABAP code to call and execute this Smart Form. Below is a sample ABAP code snippet to call the Smart Form `ZSAMPLE_SMARTFORM`:

```abap
REPORT ZSAMPLE_SMARTFORM_REPORT.

TABLES: MARA. " Example table

DATA: lt_mara TYPE TABLE OF MARA.

START-OF-SELECTION.

  SELECT * FROM MARA INTO TABLE lt_mara UP TO 10 ROWS.

  PERFORM generate_smart_form USING lt_mara.

FORM generate_smart_form USING lt_mara TYPE TABLE OF MARA.

  DATA: lo_smart_form TYPE REF TO cl_smart_form,
        lo_document  TYPE REF TO cl_document_bcs,
        lo_sender    TYPE REF TO cl_sapuser_bcs,
        lv_output    TYPE xstring.

  TRY.
      " Create an instance of the Smart Form
      CREATE OBJECT lo_smart_form
        EXPORTING
          smart_form = 'ZSAMPLE_SMARTFORM'. " Name of the Smart Form

      " Fill the Smart Form with data
      lo_smart_form->data = lt_mara.

      " Generate the Smart Form output as XSTRING
      CALL METHOD lo_smart_form->get_pdf_as_xstring
        RECEIVING
          pdf = lv_output.

      " Create a PDF document
      CREATE OBJECT lo_document
        EXPORTING
          type = 'PDF'
        IMPORTING
          document = lo_document.

      " Add the Smart Form output to the document
      lo_document->add_attachment(
        EXPORTING
          i_attachment_type  = 'PDF'
          i_attachment_subject = 'Sample Smart Form.pdf'
        IMPORTING
          i_attachment_size  = DATA(lv_size)
        CHANGING
          i_attachment_data  = lv_output ).

      " Create the sender information
      CREATE OBJECT lo_sender
        EXPORTING
          user = sy-uname.

      " Send the document via email
      CALL METHOD lo_document->send(
        EXPORTING
          i_sender = lo_sender
          i_recipient = 'recipient@example.com'
          i_subject = 'Sample Smart Form'
        EXCEPTIONS
          others = 1 ).

      IF sy-subrc = 0.
        WRITE 'Smart Form sent successfully.'.
      ELSE.
        WRITE 'Error sending Smart Form.'.
      ENDIF.

    CATCH cx_document_bcs INTO DATA(lx_document_bcs).
      WRITE 'Error creating document.'.
  ENDTRY.

ENDFORM.
```

This code demonstrates how to call the Smart Form `ZSAMPLE_SMARTFORM`, populate it with data, generate its output as a PDF, and then send it via email using SAP Business Communication Services (BCS). Adjust the code according to your specific requirements and configurations.
